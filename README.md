File Numbering Convention

This project contains multiple Arduino sketch files that end with numbers (for example: Project_01, Project_02, Project_03, etc.).
These numbers indicate the order in which the files were created or updated.

Lower numbers = earlier versions

Higher numbers = later versions

The highest number typically reflects the most recent or complete version of the project

This numbering system makes it easy to track progression, compare changes, and revert to older versions if needed.

How to Open the Files in Arduino IDE
Step 1 — Download or Clone the Project

Download the project folder as a .zip and extract it
or

Clone the repository using Git

Step 2 — Open Arduino IDE

Open the Arduino IDE software on your computer.

Step 3 — Open the Sketch Folder

Arduino requires that the sketch filename and folder name match.

To open one of the versions:

Navigate to the project folder

Open the folder for the sketch you want (e.g., Project_03)

Inside, you will find a file named something like Project_03.ino

Double-click the .ino file, or open it through:

File → Open…

Select the .ino file

Step 4 — Select the Correct Board & Port

Once the sketch is open:

Go to Tools → Board and select your ESP32 or other correct board.

Go to Tools → Port and select the COM port your device is connected to.

Step 5 — Verify and Upload

Click the ✔️ Verify button to confirm the code compiles

Click the → Upload button to upload the code to your board
